# Welcome!
I have always loved finding new musics and learning more about my tastes. As a computer science major, I have been looking for a project to develop my skills. Analyzing my Spotify track trends seemed like the perfect combination. I forked the repository from [pavelkomarov](https://github.com/annielarkins/exportify/blob/master/README.md) who built off the [Exportify](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify) project from watsonbox. 

My goal is to develop my own analysis to learn more about data visualization and eventually machine learning. I am directly using pavelkomarov's code to export csv files from Spotify. 

Stay tuned for updates!
